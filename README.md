# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Env
create file .env in root folder and add value of `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` file to your API url

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

First, run the command to install dependencies.

### `npm run dev`

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint on the project.
